# Automatic-Water-Level-Indicator-with-Motor-Control-System
This project demonstrates an automatic water level indicator with motor control. The motor starts using a run button. Based on water level switches (Low, Quarter, Half, Full), the motor turns ON or OFF and displays the current level. Top-to-bottom indication prevents overflow and improves water management.
